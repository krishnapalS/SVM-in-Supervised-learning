# Support Vector Machine Example - Machine Learning
This is code to practice concepts of Support Vector Machines

## Overview

This code is implementing a Support Vector Machine with Hinge loss and gradient descent to find the optimal decision boundary between two classes of data.

The ``svm.py`` file is extensively documented with information about Support Vector Machines and the math that goes into them.

This implementation is using a pre-defined, small sample of meaningless data. It was used to learn the concepts of SVMs.


## Dependencies

* Python
* numpy
* matplotlib

## Usage

Just run ``python3 svm.py`` to see the results:

### Plot of the Rate of classification errors during training
